Today our mentor asked us to attend the meeting at 5:30
where we should show the model inverted pendulum with pivot and without pivot also,but we had some
problems in implementing that so we asked some doubts.

Minutes of meeting
Agenda:
My team was assigned to show two working and well tuned models of inverted pendulum(with pivot and without pivot).
But we were unable to tune them ,so we told the mentor the problems we are facing.He commented that we are on the
right track but we are missing something.He asked as to get help from other team
