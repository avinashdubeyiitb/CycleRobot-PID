project 17 daily report(20-05-2020)Aniket Nayak.

Today, we have to choose the example through we should able to complete our task as assigned.
 
We discuss many problem statement and their solutions for our task but we are not able 
to finalize it. Tomorrow, we will discuss all this Statements with our mentors to finalize it.

Statements:-
1. We will use our cycle bot to explain all the topic.
2.Spring mass damper system.
3.angle or velocity control of DC motor
4.altitude control of drone in 1d/2d
5.throttle controlling of gas pedal for velocity control of car(in cruise control system)
6.RLC circuit.

then, i have doubt that,for the example , we have to simulate only in v-rep or we can use 
graphs representation in scilab/octave for the  representation of our systems 
 and for futher explanation or both is compulsry .
