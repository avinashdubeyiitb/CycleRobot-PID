Agenda:To review week 2 task progress

In the meeting we discussed about week 2 tasks.
Actually we thought we have to directly make tutorials,but later we came
to know that we have to make document first and after that we have to make video.
Our mentors asked us to make all the documents and submit before 9:30 PM

Today we worked on documents whole day.I wrote all the documents in latex that
aniket and prit provided.we submitted everything before the deadline.
