project 17 daily report(18 & 19 & 20 june 2020)Aniket Nayak

During this span of three days, i worked on the code for the uniform samplying using
intrrupts debugging it and works on kalman filter and PID tuning for our cycle bot.
All the details of work and problem faced given below.

1. In the code of uniform samplying we developed the code for it in the earlier week 
   experiment but the problem we face is we are not used servo libraries or pwm signal
   in that code, but for the controlling reaction wheel, navigation and back wheel we
   are using the pwm signal. But we know that the timers are directly associated with
   pwm signals and arduino generates pwm using it but we don't that the servo library 
   is using the same timer that we are using, if this is the case, then, the timers are
   overwriten and generate error. And this is what is happening and our code doesn't 
   compile.

Problem solved :- This is now solved when we figure out that the servo library just 
                  enables all the timers of arduino, then we found the alernative
                  servo library which doesn't do that, i.e servoTimer2.h it uses timer 2

2. I learned about the kalman filter and all its 5 equations but mainly we need 3 
   equation in our cycle bot i.e
                   1. state update equation
                   2. Kalman gain equation
                   3. covariance update equation.
   Still, not used pratically, as our metor suggested to stick with the complimentary
   filter at this time.

3. Tuning the PID, it is still on process as we still not able to tune it properly, we 
   discusses this problem with our mentor, they suggested to use famous Z_N method
   for tuning but it is still not tunned, it is balancing for few seconds and then, it
   will come to ground, we all are working on it and hope to figure it out as soon as
   possible.
