Project 17 (30-05-2020) Aniket Nayak

Then, after that I designed all the things in the v-rep to chech weather this design is 
applicable or not then i designed things in it accordingly. But, it doesn't behave properly 
as weight distribution is not correct. 
then, i review my model and shift some of the components after analysis, now, its works but 
not ideally but it works fine for physical implementation.

Then, i made the documentation for the day 1 and day 2 
i.e choose your robot design 
and designing all the parts in v-rep.

In choose your robot design and v-rep designing documentation, I explained the placement of 
all the components and why it is placed there and the reason behind it.
