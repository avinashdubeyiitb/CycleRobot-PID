Now we have the model of the inverted pendulum,so it's time for code and simulation.

So I learnt how can we control the simulation in v-rep through Python.
I learnt how can we add objects to the scene through python.

I tried getting the angle of the dummy using python but i faced many problems there.

The main problem is there are very less resources for learning v-rep completely.

Due to heavy rain I could not attend the mentoring session.
