#internship week 3 report
In this whole week we have worked for designing and hardware selection. In this week we have attended 3 expert seminars on national and international issues also.

As the internship part in this week we have chose the actual design with all reason for 'why?'. And also implemented it in V-rep. We also gone through so much documentations and compressions to understand requirements to choose appropreate hardware for actual use and then we have modelled those hardware in v-rep and implemented an final cycle module.  We have also decided where to implement our sensor for getting the bes results.
