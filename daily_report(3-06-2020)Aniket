Today, i learned about Effect of samplying frequency. How it effect the output signal.
I come to know about the condition of samplying process i.e Nyquist rate.

 In general, to preserve the full information in the signal, it is necessary to sample at 
twice the maximum frequency of the signal.  This is known as the Nyquist rate.  
The Sampling Theorem states that a signal can be exactly reproduced if it is sampled at a 
frequency F, where F is greater than twice the maximum frequency in the signal.

Learned abou aliasing.
As the sampling frequency decreases, the signal separation also decreases.  
When the sampling frequency drops below the Nyquist rate, the frequencies will crossover 
and cause aliasing.

And aliasing can be prevented by using low-pass filter.

Now, i am working on the documentation of the all the above topic.

Today we also have our guest lecture by Dr. Vandana shiva, it is very good session and we come
to know about many policies of american which would adversely effects our life and effecting,
she shares the cause of many diseases, which is misleaded to us in the name of healthy food.
And changes our prospective towards the farming culture.

And its been a great session much as a building character and change the prospective.
