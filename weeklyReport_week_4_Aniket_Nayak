Project 17 Weekly report week 4 Aniket Nayak 

In this week, i learned a alot of things but the major learning are :-

1. Why to shift from countinous to discrete time function.
2. Change the transfer function from s-plane to z-plane for discretization to know about
   its stability criteria and the behaviour of the discrete system.
   -- Implementation in octave and the conversions from countinous to discrete and zero order
      hold(ZOD)
3. Effect of samplying frequency.
   --aliasing
   --anti-aliasing filter
4. How to do uniform samplying using interrupts 
   --Hardware generated timers/counters.

Although, every member of the team helps each other in almost every work and contributes to
complete all the tasks, But my mojor countribution in it is:-

1. Documentation of Why to shift from countinous to discrete time function.
2. Documentation of Effect of samplying frequency.
3. Helps in the 2 and 4 part of major learning, in finding the problem statement and solving 
   the problems.

Alot of things learned from the presentation cremony and the topic assigned to us.
My countribution in the presentation is in collecting datas for the impact of Ai in jobs and 
region, this file is shared in the github repo by the name of "DATA FOR IMPACT OF AI".
