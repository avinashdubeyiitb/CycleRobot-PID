In the previous meeting they have assigned a task i.e to think of two examples.We
thought spring mass damper can explain the concept of control system and we can model and simulate it in V-rep also.
So we finalized first example.We thought of simple swinging machine for gardens that will never stop itself .But our
mentors said it will not be a proper example.
We were so confused in choosing the second example.
