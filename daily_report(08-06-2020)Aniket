Project 17 daily report (08-06-2020) Aniket Nayak

Today i have my first semester exam of thermodynamics of 3 hours.
Then, after the exam ends. we have mentoring session.

Motive of mentoring session:-
To review the previous work and give suggestion and assign new final tasks to complete.
in this week, we will make all the documents for controller we are using and remote.
And also, have to make the structure of the cycle bot.

Then we have guest lecture on "MENTAL HEALLTH":-
In this i came acroos things like depression , anxiety and many more terms. 
Most importantly now i understand it in better way, in past i am mot think much of these kind
of things.

Most important point that i learned from that is, How to behave with person and helps him who 
is suffering from this type of problems. I think many parts of our areas are still not aware of 
this and make fun of it that should be change in upcoming time.

Also, revise my conceots for PID controller.
