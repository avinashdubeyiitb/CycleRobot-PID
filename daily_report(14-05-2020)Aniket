Yesterday, I was facing problem how to get data of joint orientation, so that i could 
control the signal.

today, i figured it out that v-rep has a function for that and using this we can get the
angle of the joint. But it is valid only for joints.

Then, I developed PID controller to control the velocity of the rection wheel and its start
working. Then after, i have tune the kp,ki and kd gains by observing the behaviour of the
pendulum. then i tuned it at its best. But now i am facing problem is that the pendulum 
is oscilating at an angle of 0.5 to 0.7 not at desired angle which is 0.
 I changed various kp, ki and kd. But it doesn't effect this.

Then, I tried to control it by torque as  the output of the Pid not velocity, but it doesn't
work properly.

Then, Prit varmora suggested to change the parameters like inertia , mass and the length,
breadth, height of various things and it works but not works ideally. And he gives all these 
values.

then, I designed v shaped inverted pendulum at bottom without bottom joint in vrep.File is 
shared in the group of daily_report. And also get the data of the angle of orientation of 
the pendulum which is different from the other case because the function is work for only
joint function. This time there will be no joint. So, i get it by using dummy as a 
reference coordinate to the pendulum arm's coordinate and i get the angle from that.
