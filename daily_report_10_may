I tried importing solidworks cycle model in v-rep but i faced many problems there.there was an 
error saying "It appears that the dynamic content includes non-pure non-convex shapes..."
 then i watched some of the v-rep tutorials from Leopoldo Armesto channel
then i watched a v-rep tutorial :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9DXTRUmEEE
but i got so many doubts there.

we had team meeting today and we have decided that i will work coding part and aniketh will work on physical
modelling and prit will focus on mathematical modelling.

The day was great,I have learnt so many things today
