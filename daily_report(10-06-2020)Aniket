Project 17 daily report (10-06-2020) Aniket Nayak

Today i learned about how to tune the PID parameters manually by looking at its behaviour.
There are alot of methods available but the two good methods i learn is given below:-
1. Heuristic A Method and 
2. Zeigler-Nichols Method

From this two method you can tune your PID parameters pretty well.

Then after i documented the "IMPLEMENTATION OF PID IN ARDUINO"
and "TUNING THE PID PARAMETERS".
documentation of both the things are done.

GUEST LECTURE :-
We have guest lecture on "NOT LISTEN TO YOUR PARENT", the topic is little wierd but after 
attending the session it clears my doubt why the title of the topic is like this.
Learning : Why we should invest money at very early stage and the purpose of it.
