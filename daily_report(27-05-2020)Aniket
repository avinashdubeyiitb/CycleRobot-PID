And assign next tasks and this week deliverables. And gave us suggestion regarding 
how to approach and solve the problem and design experiments.

Then, we do our own meeting to decide what are examples we should take and discuss
various things to distribute various things.

We decided to take the example of cycle bot to work on topics.
we distributed the topics to work on, I am now working on communication protocol 
and Remote design.

Then, we have guest lecture on geo-economics,
in which we came across things like how our country's economy and world's economy work.
And the various factors that effect the GDP and how we the next generation contribute
