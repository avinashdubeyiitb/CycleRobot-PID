Today, i collected data for all the components like dimensions and weight.

Then, made rough design on paper how the cycle bot design will be physically and which
component placed where to make it stable. And the dimensions of the cycle and the thickness 
of the material through which we will made its body which is most probably plywood(if available
we will try other option because plywood is very heavy).

I also has my internal exam. so, i am preparing for that also.

Then, we have guest lecture on "Rise of technology in china", through this lecture i learned
about how the peoples of china works and some benefits and consequences of living in china.
How there government provide themselves all the needed things but they have sacrifice their
freedom for that. The reason, behind there strong economy.
