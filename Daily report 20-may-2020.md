# internship day week day3 20-may 2020

Today i gone through lots of examples of controle system and tried to find out the examples to make tutorials. After that we have took the examples and got a meeting with team and we all have mutually discussed different examples and at last we have decided that we will explain all the concepts through example of a swing and we will design an controller to make an underdamped swing critically damped but as the model will be non linear the mentor suggested us that the example can be difficult to understand and that's why we needed to cancel it. And search for an appropreate example that can cover all things is not ended yet.
