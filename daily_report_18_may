Yesterday and today we worked on cycle bot simulation.
we didn't face much problem as cycle bot is exactly similar to inverted pendulum with reaction wheel.

In the next meeting we have to show the simulation of cycle bot i.e balancing with reaction wheel
and also movement of the bot.so we designed interface to control the speed of the motor and direction of the handle.
We used gyrosensor and accelerometer to get orientation because,if we use the function getObject Orientation then
we will can use only on angle i.e w.rt x,y or z.If we turn the cycle then we should get angle w.r.t to different axis.
So we considered gyrosensor and accelerometer.We used 96% of gyrosensor data and 4% of accelerometer data(Complementory filter)
to get the the orientation.
