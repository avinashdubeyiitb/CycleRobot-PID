Project 17 daily report (11 & 12 & 13-06-2020) Aniket Nayak

In these three days, i completed all my tasks and documentation of this week.
As my final semester exam is going on i am busy on that part also, but i done my
part of all the documentation process. 

1. Effect of derivative and integral regulators in PID controller i.e
   --integral controller makes the system slow but can rectify the steady state error.
   --derivative controller makes the system beviour faster and quick but the 
     derivative controller is highly sensitive to the noise.

2. Done with the documentation of this in which i explain the mathematics of both the
   integral and derivative regulator individually and how it contributed towards the
   behaviour of the system and there limitations.

3. Navigation of cycle bot and remote control
   In this documentation i explain how the remote control the left right motion and
   what to do with the joystick to control the speed of the cycle bot and the forward 
   and reverse motion and left right motion via remote(joystick). This part is not
   the technical doucment but the manual to navigate the cycle bot using remote.

All of them can understand it while reading, the technical part and the science behind 
it is explained earlier documentation in the week 3.
All the week tasks is completed and uploaded on git hub.

guest lecturs and mentoring session:-

In the guest lecture, sriram sir explained how to write code and how to pre process the
the code while writing and the order to make system more robust.

Motive of mentoring session is to solve our problems that we are facing like we were
modifing alot the structure of the reaction wheel and we are not getting how much
we have to put the weight of that. But our mentor tells us to stick with the one weight
and change in code to balance.
