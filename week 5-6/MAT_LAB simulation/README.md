first run file named '1_CB_simulation_paremeter.m' it will define all perameters in workspace and then simulate simulink file "2_PID_tuning.slx"
in file "2_PID_tuning.slx" there is 3 models 1 for continuous and 2 for descreat time syatem 

after raunning '1_CB_simulation_paremeter.m' file we need to update discreat model transfer function in "2_PID_tuning.slx" file and then we can tune PID controller there
