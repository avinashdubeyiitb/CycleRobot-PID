#internship week 7 day 1  

Today I have commented all the files and described every function  in file other then it I have revisited complementary algorithm  to find any advanced modification if any but the method i was using was already modified complementary filer other then it i have modified code so that I can edit and test diffrent combinations of gain while running the execution from the serial monitor and using it I have tried to balance the robot but still its not balancing. Now i am going to modify disc weight and parameter  

I have also revisited the PID controller algorithm to find any optimization.
