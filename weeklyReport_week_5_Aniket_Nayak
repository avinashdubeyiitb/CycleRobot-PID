Project 17 weekly report week_5 Aniket Nayak

This week much devoted to the physical designing of the cycle bot and the controller 
designing. And to learn and document about the effects, limitation of P-I-D controller 
individually and combine and how it will effiect the system behaviour.

And also the navigation of cycle bot and remote control and its documentation.

MAJOR LEARNING :-

1. Effect of proportional controller, proportional controller is directly proportional
   to the  error signal almost done our work, but not completely because of the
   steady state error.
2. Effect of derivative and integral regulators in PID controller i.e
   --integral controller makes the system slow but can rectify the steady state error.
   --derivative controller makes the system beviour faster and quick but the 
     derivative controller is highly sensitive to the noise.
3. Why not Derivative or Integral Controller alone. What are the problem associated with
   this and it will affects the system behaviour or not. If affect at what cost.
4. Implementing PID in Arduino and Tuning the Parameters.
     I learned about how to tune the PID parameters manually by looking at its behaviour.
     There are alot of methods available but the two good methods i learned is given below:-
     1. Heuristic A Method and 
     2. Zeigler-Nichols Method

MY MAJOR CONTRIBUTION :-
Although all the work is done by the team work and after discussion, my major contributtion
in the documentation and other is given below :-

1. Why Derivative and/or Integral Controller?
2. Why not Derivative or Integral Controller alone?
3. Implementing PID in Arduino and Tuning the Parameters.
4. Strategy for Navigation Via Remote Control
5. Effect of Proportional Controller( majorly hruthwik)
6. Helps prit in component placement for physical design( design idea(v-rep) is given by me But 
   making the whole body with one aluninum pipe that is by prit).
