#internship week3 day2 (27 - may -2020)

Today i have tried to shorted out which accelerometer and gyro sensor to be used, in search of that i found that we are provided with gy-87 that consist of mpu 9250 (mpu 6050 series) but the board is coasting us for 450 rupees because it consist of magnetometer and pressure sensor no board but that extra sections are worthless for us as it is not going to use at all so as an option of that ic i have found a board called gy521 which is consisting of mpu 6050 (same accel/gyro ic as gy 87) but costing me only 150 rupees. 

So i have decided to design experiments on the board gy521. and i have read some comparison articles on that 

At the evening I have also attended the session foe geo-economics addressed by 
Dr. Ajit Ranade

Mom(with avijit pandey sir)

Agenda: to short out daily bases problem if any.

In this meeting we have discussed about hardware description and also we have discussed about gy-87 vs gy521

Action plane for next meeting: to complete as more work as possible.
