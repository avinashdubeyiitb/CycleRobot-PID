Because of heavy rain,I didn't have network,So i was not able to work yesterday
Today prit and me discussed about writing ISR and uniform sampling,we decided to take an example of
led blinking by using timer0 but later we got to know that timero is not enough as it
is 8 bit timer so we used timer1(16 bit).
