Today we had presention at 11;00 am.Kavi sir asked us about the project 
and what is the differnce between simulation and implementing in the real world.
Prit answered that question i.e In simulation everything will be ideal but in real implementation 
we were bounde by many limitations of the motor etc.Kavi sir appreciated our work.
I attended some more sessions in the afternoon.
