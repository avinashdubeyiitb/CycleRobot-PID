Today we had meeting with mentors at 10:30 am we discussed some of the ideas we had like drone
altitude control system,etc but we didn't come to conclusion yet.We have made a problem statement for the first example.

We have attended one more eeting today to discuss about the first progrees presentation.For that we have to create
a ppt in the mentioned format.
In that ppt we wrote all the things that we have done with pictorial represention.Most of the time was spent in learning latex only.
