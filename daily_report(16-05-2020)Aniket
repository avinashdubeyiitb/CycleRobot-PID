Project 17 Team b  Saturday Aniket Nayak(16-05-2020)

Its very tough day for us, we have to find all the errors and have rectify it. Yesterday,
the oscillations in the inverted pendulum with motor is now rectified as per the instructions
suggested by the other team member. But our team is not satisfied by it because i have 
doubts regarding this because jai suggested that we have to set the pivot motor in mode
of dependent mode to the reaction wheel motor.

But we have to set is free to move. so, it can go on either direction of the axis .
Then we shift all our main code from actuation to joint call back function in we are
now controlling the torque not the velocity and apply the PID algorithm inside this 
function without any conditions applied . Now, we can say it behaves ideally.

Now, we shift our attention to second task to balance it without motor and make the base 
V shape like structure so that only line of contact has to be set with the ground.
Now, we design a model for that inspired a little from other team (only the base portion)
I apply the algorithm for PID and various other logics and i am suceeded in my task.

Tommorrow, i will try it on another design that i designed earlier and have some problem
regarding the structure designing and try to figured it out. and also work on the designing
of the final cycle bot design and try to perform various actions.
