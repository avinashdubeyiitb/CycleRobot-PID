Project 17 (01-06-2020) Aniket Nayak

Today, i spent mostly may time with the learning basics of kalman filter and how it works.
How to find kalman filter gain, how it can adjust its value by the errors in estimation and 
measurement.
Through the value of kalman gain You can tell the which parameter gives you more accurate 
results like if the value of kalman  gain is one then the meaurement by the instrument are 
stable no uncernities present there. And if the value is more towards zero than the measuremnt
are unstable but the estimation error will be small this factor compensate the the uncernities
present and make the current estimation more accurate.

Through, kalman you can handle uncernities pretty well.

Today, we also have mentoring session.
Motive of mentoring session:-

Why we have to change our system from countinous time domain function to descrete time domain 
function?
And to give us our future tasks.
