Date:01 to 07 June

In these week as per the schedule we worked on some topics to gain deeper understanding in control system.
We designed 2 experiments for the explanation of the topics

1)Converting transfer function from continous to discrete in octave.
2)Uniform sampling by writing ISRs.

I learnt about how interrupts actually work and we implemented blinking led using timer1.

We had villa wise presentations,but due to heavy rain i coudn't attend that.
