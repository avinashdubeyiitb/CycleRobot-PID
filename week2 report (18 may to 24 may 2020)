#internship week2 report (18 may to 24 may 2020)

Through the week we were supposed to make tutorials to explain controle system concepts like...

Demonstration of the Control System Via Cycle Bot and Biped Patrol
Concept of Transfer Function Based Modelling. We can take examples of RLC circuits and Mechanical Spring Damper System to Demonstrate.
Understanding Poles and Zeros of a Transfer Function. Stability criteria for a system
Time domain characteristics of system
Physical interpretation of damping

For making this now the main task was to find some examples in which we can cover all the related topics properly and the tutorials may also work for very beginner students. so through the week we got through so many examples related to given concepts and talked on everyone within the teem very briefly and also under some suggestion of mentors we have finalized spring mass damper and RLC circuit examples and planned all work flow till Friday and till then we all also gathered all the required materials and sources required for this . 

Then we have distributed work among the team and in my portion i got the task to make required ppt and to voice over theory portion, aniket got to voice over scilab, xcos and problem statement portion and hrithivik tasked by combine and edit all the videos and also to make tutorial for v-rep. then to remove background noise hruthvik added some background music and we verified content and submitted the links
