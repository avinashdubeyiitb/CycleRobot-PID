# internship day week2 day2 19-may 2020

To day i have revisited the cycle bot on v-rep and tried to improve performance and compared various graphs with diffrent tuning co-officiant of complementary filter and concluded that at 0.98 i gets the best performance.

Other than this I have revisited some concepts regarding controle theory and stability other then this I have also got to know about diffrent types of controllers. I have also read some articles on diffrence between classical controllers and optimal controllers. I am  now searching for some examples of controle system so that we can explain some concepts of controle system.

Moments of meetings:

Today in meeting we had submitted our 3 tasks 
1)inverted pendulum balanced using reaction wheel with pivot (here)
2)inverted pendulum balanced using reaction wheel without pivot(here)
3)cycle bot balanced using reaction wheel and also controlled its navigation (here)

Mentor reviewed that the cycle bot is seeming more stable that usal.
So i have shown some comparison graphs to explain them why it is stable because i have tried to optimize it in more analytical way.

Action plane for next meeting:
In the next meeting we are supposed to come up with idea regarding an example and problem statement of the system on which we can explain and solve parameters of control system.
