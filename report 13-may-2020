#interenship day 4 (13/5/2020)

Today i have mainly searched about mathematical modeling and noticed some points.

Unlike other type of inverted pendulum such as rotary or cart they require a runway or platform to balance itself because it is balanced by motion of the whole pendulum. However, reaction wheel inverted pendulum is balance by torque generated by the motor. This requires no platform or runway making it compact and rigid. 

As mentioned above the height is designed to be 50 cm because shorter height only generates small amount of torque to counter balance the pendulum. Although greater height generates more torque, however the torque generated by the weight is also increases as the height increases. Thus, 50 cm is the optimum height for the inverted pendulum.

I have made an module in matlab - simulink to test behaviour of system and also implemented PID controller within it and tried Ziegler-Nichols tuning method to tune behaviour of system.
And finalised the Kp, Ki, Kd. For system.
System equation :



The derived finalized gains are as below.
