#internship week 5 weekly report 

In this week I have started to built real physical hardware first of all I thought to built it from wooden material but it was increasing size and weight of cycle so i have decided to make it from aluminium pipes and scrape to make it less in size and light weight. 
The full construction of real physical model of cycle is described here:

I have also developed whole working code distributed in 3 header files and 1 main function file and also tested the same the first basic code is here:

I have also tuned and nullified gyro and angle offsets by experimenting lots of things on it  and modified the file according to it.

Other then it I have changed some hardware as per requirement like increasing inertia of reaction wheel.

I have tried a lot to balance the bot by tuning the PID controller of it but till now i just failed to do this.
