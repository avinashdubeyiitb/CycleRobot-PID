#Internship day2(11/05/2020)-Hruthwik K

today i have read 4 research papers that were shared in the group

Mentoring session:

1)I got to know how centre of gravity will affect our system.


2)Our mentor used the example of see-saw to teach us how cg will affect the system.In which he placed two object of equal mass one close to pivote point and one is away from the pivot point.As the closer object has small perpendicular distance less force is needed there.


3)Then ,he assigned us a task to model and simulate a simple inverted pendulum.
