# Internship Week 4 weekly report 

In this week we supposed to design experiments and make documentations on the following topics and have to learn them properly.

	1) Why to shift from Continuous to Discrete?
	2) Transfer Function Conversion from continuous time to discrete time in octave
	3) Changes in criterion of stability? Why ?
	4) effect of sampling frequency
	5) Ensuring uniform sampling in arduino by Writing ISRs
	
For explaining them in experimental way we have designed 2 experiments 

	1) Explaining and performing discretisation on an continuous time system and testing and observing it on octave
	2) Explaining and performing uniform sampling using timer interrupt in ATmega2560 with the use of Arduino mega board.
During designing 1st experiment  we have learnt lot more things like z plane and relative stability and how to convert continuous time domain method to discrete time domain and corresponding z-domain(frequency domain) method and also why and how stability criteria gets changed with discretisation of signal. 

During 2nd experiment I have learnt how to generate uniform sampling using timer interrupts. And also became familiar with the functionality of timers and counters in Atmega 2560.

Other then this regular work we were also having an u-villa presentation on A-I and its effect on jobs and socity. I was eagerly wanted to join this presetation but as because of dark out i couldn't attend any phase of that.
