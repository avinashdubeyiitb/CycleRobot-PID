Project 17 daily report (05-06-2020) Aniket Nayak

Today, i learned about the timers and counters hardware ones. I am only used the software 
function of millis() in arduino for the timer. 

Now, how to use hardware timers to count the pulses and through pulses you can count the time
in seconds.
You can modify the specs of the timers by writing the correct register values and prescalar.

And for uniform samplying we use interrupt service routine and timer both to get the result.
Interrupt generraly doesnot effects the main code(it runs smoothly as per code) But when 
interrupt occurs it goes to that section and execute that code and then resumes the main code.

There are inbuilt function to enable interrupts and use as per your need.
