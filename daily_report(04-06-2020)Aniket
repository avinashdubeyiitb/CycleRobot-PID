Today, i learned Transfer Function Conversion from continuous time to discrete time, i.e
s-plane to z-plane and the stability criteria of the pole placement in the z-plane.

You can manually convert it or you can use octave to convert the signal and show the poles to
state about its stability, i.e if it is inside the unit circle then the system is stable, 
otherwise it is unstable.

Another thing is that You cannot directly give discrete signal to the plant/system as a 
discrete is nothing but impulsess at different time intervals, we have to hold that impulse 
signal until another impuse signal and this is called zero order hold(ZOD).
In real world we use DAC and in octave we have the function for it we just have to pass the
arrgument of 'ZOD' into  the funtion.

Then, this signal is fed into the system to give the output accordingly.
