Project#17 team b Aniket Nayak (12-05-2020)

today, as per our mentor we have to first design and model simple inverted pendulum with reaction wheel,
and learn from this project. 

So,i designed simple inverted pendulum with reaction wheel and studied about various parameters which
should effect its behaviour ( source:- reaserch paper will be shared in the resource section )

reaserch paper reffered:-https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8646093

Recovery angle - which is the maximum angle from which the pendulum can become upright

Points concluded:-

1. if we increase the length of the pendulum arm recovery angle decreases
2. System can produce more acceleration for same torque if we decrease intertia(directly in relation with length
   of pendulum arm)
3. if we decrease the mass of the reaction wheel recovery angle increases.
4. + the plus point with the increase in mass of the rection wheel is that 
  ---- it increases inertia ,which increase time the motor imparts torque on arm, increases the recovery angle.
  --------inc in inertia leads to less angular acceleration for the same torque therefore, time constt for the 
           motor to reach saturation is greater.
5. By increases the radius we can counter point(3) because mass is proportional to intertia but also it is proportional
   to the square of radius, dec in mass, which increases recovery angle.

later, We discussed and distribute work.  now, we have work on programming part. 
So, i start learning how to start programming in lua ( i taken help from team A member chinmay palaye)
now, hruthwik and working on this part.

Learned how to change codes in non-threaded child script
