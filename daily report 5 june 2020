#internship week4 day 5

Today I have completed making documentation and designing proper experiment for learning z-plane and related stability concepts in this documentations I have completed day 3 and day 4 . To day I have also started working on next experiment topic 'using interrupt to generate uniform sampling time interval'. For that I have studied the structure and related registers for timers in Arduino Uno board and the designing of experiments and tasks is remaining to design and work on.

Today we was having an meeting for presentation on AI prepared by U-villa batch mates but because of all day dark out in my area i couldn't attempt it.
