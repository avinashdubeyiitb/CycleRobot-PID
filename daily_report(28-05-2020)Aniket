Project 17 (28-05-2020)Aniket Nayak

Today i made complete documentation on communication protocol for serial and wireless
And then, for remote design, using an example/experiment on it.

Problem statement: To control the speed of the DC motor wirelessly using Xbee module.
then, how to design remote and the factor it dependa upon and controlling factors and cost
effectiveness.

In communication protocol documentation, it gives you an over view of SPI, I2C, UART serial 
communication and how to configure Xbee and control and transmit data wirelessly
and block diagram of working of the experiment.
