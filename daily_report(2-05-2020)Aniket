Project 17 daily report(2-06-2020) Aniket Nayak

Because of my final semester exams is from 8-06-2020 I to have submit all my college work 
like presentations , case study report and internals. So, i was bit enagged in it.

But i also contributed toward the task assigned. first i have to make a documentation on 
Why we shift from continous to discrete?
For that, i have to first understand about what is continous and discrete time signals.

I watched this video for understanding the signals.

After watching this it just cleared all my doubts about it.

Then, i start making the doucmentation for this topic in this i included the disadvantages of 
discrete time signals when conversion occurs from continous time signal like loss of 
information, quantization error and delays and what is sampling time.
