today, I learned about control system in which the main part is 
Spring mass damper System.
finding differntial Equation using newton's second law of motion.
converting the Equation into s-domain function.

And also observing the behaviour of the output in scilab using xcos.
By changing the damping constant, i can see the change in the output
function like, over damped system, critical damped system, under-damped system.

learn about various parameters like, transient time, rise time, settling time.

learned how to get zeros and poles from the transfer function.

Stability criteria:-

The numerator of the transfer fuction is called zeros and denominator is called poles.

If a pole exists on the right plane of the graphical repersentation of the complex
s-plane, it means system is unstable. 

If a pole exists on the left plane of the graphical repersentation of the complex
s-plane, it means system is stable.
