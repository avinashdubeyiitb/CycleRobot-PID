Project #17 Aniket Nayak friday(15-05-2020)

Our design is not working ideally there is a error which we just cannot get rid of it. 
And tried our level best to figuring it out . but the error continuosly comes.

Now, I design another physical models for verfying that it occurs in this designing or 
other comes in other design also. But it comes in almost every design.
the error is, the oscillates at a gap of 0.3 radian angle from desired one .

then, we have mentoring Session:-

Agenda:- What is the problems regarding the simulation and our next that we to prepare
         for.

we shows our design along with the code to our mentor, they ask us to change gains and
physical parameters but still the error continues. we all just stuck on one which is not
working.

then, our mentors tells our next task and the deadlines and what we have to do in the next 
week, we go through the curriculum of the next week and prepare one example for each 
topic.

Now, our mentor told us to collaborate with other team. so that, we can find the solution 
for the problem .

The other team's member jai garg help me in finding the solution of the error and the 
solution is written all the code(script) in under the wrongh part. we have to write it
under the part which we have to control.

Another problem is that, For joint control there is a function which we have to call
and the under it, not the under the actuation function. And this solves our problem.
And now our model is working well.
