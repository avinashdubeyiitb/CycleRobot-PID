#internship week 4 day 3
 Today I have researched about z plane that how z plane works and how s-plane relates to z plan and also how to map from s-plane to z plane. In this learning i have found this 3 links worthy  for learning.

Relationship between s/z planes and time domain

 other than it i have also referred theory about how sampling time relates to performance of system and also how it  affects the pole position in z plane. 

I have also referred some content for converting transfer function to z domain transfer function and its diffrent method though it is still remaining to learn properly in depth.
