Project 17 weekly_report week 6 Aniket Nayak

The main focus of this week is to balance the cycle bot and do all the activities 
related to this like code to get the right angle, for uniform samplying, for navigation
remote control and controlling the reaction wheel.

We faced numerous problems in this week and solved quiet few of it but our ultimate goal
to balance the cycle bot is still not achieved.

All the stuff done by us or me is explained in the daily reports along with the problem
faced. So, i don't repeat it here all the things just putting the heading of it.

MAJOR PROBLEMS FACED:-

1. Tuning the complimentary filter - when we give weightage to gyro rate of giving data
   lags if u give the weight to accelerometer noises becomes sensitive to the angle.

2. In uniform sampling - compilation error

3. Tuning the PID parameters.

PROBLEMS SOLVED:-

1. tunning of filter is done and angle values are comming well but i try to learn the 
   kalman filter and implement it but it needs time and our mentor suggested to stick
   with the complimentory.

2. using the library servoTimer2 we get rid of the complilation error, but the system 
   still doen't repond to the code, but we find the alternative for that.

But the biggest problem is still not solved is the tuning of the PID parameters, we did
almost everything to find it but we still cannot do, we are working on it and hopefully
we will do that before the deadlines.
