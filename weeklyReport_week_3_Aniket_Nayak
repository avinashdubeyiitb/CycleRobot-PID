Project 17 week_report_3 Aniket Nayak

In this week, 
The major learning of the week is on the hardware part like appropriate design for the cycle 
bot, components needed and their placement. Choosing the specfication and what are the factros
that one should keep in mind while designing physically a bot.

How to communicate with the bot wirelessly to control its parameter and the communication 
protocols.

How to choose approrite sensor which is both cost effective and performance effective.
and the filter designing for the data give by sensor like complementary(applied) and kalman 
filter( not applied theory only). 

Then, the remote designing and optimization of the remote.

And at last, all the components are assembled in v-rep software to see thw behaviour and whether 
the placement of the system is stable and correctly placed or not. And this help us when we 
design our model physically.

This is the major learning in the technical portion.

Major learning from guest lectures.
1. What is geo-politics?. How it effects us and our country.
2. Geo-economics. in this part i learned how our gdp and economics of the works and what are 
   factors  that a country depends and a true defination of the developing and developed country.
3. Rise of technology in china.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My contribution :-
1.Made the documentation for robot design.(problem statement and solution)
2.Made the v-rep file in which you can see which components is placed where.
3.Also made a document for it which component placed where and why.
4.Experiment designing for communication protocol and remote design.
5.Also the documentation for both(problem and soluton).
