Hruthwik K
Date:25 to 31 May

In this week,
The agenda was to learn more about hardware.So we have design the bot exactly similar to the bot we are going
to model physically in the upcoming weeks.
We discussed about the components needed and how we can place them in the bot etc.
We also discussed about the filter we will need.We concluded that complementary is sufficient for us.
When we divided the work i got the design part in fusion360.
So I learnt modelling in fusion 360 and modelled wheels for the bot.
At last we combined all the parts in V-rep.
Also I did the documentaion of all files in latex that were shared by my teammates.
We had 3 guest lectures this week.
	1)Geo-Politics
	2)Geo-Economics
	3)Rise of technology in china
We learnt a lot in these guest lectures.
