#internship week3 day2 (26 - may -2020)

Moments of meeting (10:00am - 10:30 am)
Agenda: to review about week 2 progression.

In this meeting we have discussed about week 2 tutorial making. Actually because of some misunderstanding we have directly made video tutorials but the actual procedure we required to follow was to make first written document and after approval of mentor we have to make video tutorials but our documentation work was remaining.

Next meeting agenda: to review documents that we have made today

Today all day we have worked to make documentation of the content. And we have completed and made an hierarchical folders for problem statements and solutions in latex and submitted it by 9:30 pm on git hub.
