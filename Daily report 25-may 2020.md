# internship week3- day 1 (25 - may 2020)
Today I have rechecked the made tutorials and we together shorted out some little issue in that and also I have took overview on types of filters for data fusion. And i also read some article for that and revised concept of it
I have also referred mpu 6050 data sheet again. 

Today i have attended a very fruitful session on geo politics addressed by 
Admiral Anil Chopra

And he explained everything about history and how it relates to geo politics and also explained us hoe it affects our life..
The one main sentence i got from his presentation was 
'just because u don't take interest in world and politics it doesn't mean that politics will also not take an interest in you' 
In the session the my favourite part was QNA session in which i also asked a question thatas an navy officer what you expects to develop from us the innovators and engineers to make navy more powerful and make soldier life safe ?for which he answered that ..
If you are finding safety then it can never be possible as a soldier ....(the sentence was so powerful i found)
And he said that America is developing kind of wepon like lesser to shoot air fighter if we can have the same then it will 
If you can develop some unmanned under water drone that can be communicate with sonar and can be released in quantity and same kind of Arial drones than it can also be very helpful 
He also said that if we can make and develop some vehicles that can work under water and using which soldier can operate underwater. 

"i think as an very powerful internship provider e-yantra should pay attention to it"
The outcomes can really be very powerful.
