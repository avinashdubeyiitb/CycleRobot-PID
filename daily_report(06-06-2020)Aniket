project 17 daily report(06-06-2020) Aniket Nayak

Today, is our presentation day and we are all done with our reserch and now its time to 
implement the whole thing in one presentation.

We done with the presentation part as divided by the small section assigned.
Then, we have merge all the 3 presentation videos and present to our mentor first, they will
verify it first and give green signal to it.

We showed our work to our mentor and they gave us feedback and now, we have modify a little 
and merge all the video.

And all the work is just finished before the deadline.

My countribution in the presentation is in collecting datas for the impact of Ai in jobs and 
region, this file is shared in the github repo by the name of "DATA OF IMPACT OF AI".

The presentation cremony, we and 2 other team present their work and we learned alot from the 
discussions as our topic is Will Al take our job or not?

We gave our point of view that it will not but it will creates jobs and improves the work 
efficiency but jobs will affected but not much we have to upgrade our skills.

But after the conversation we had, i learned that it will create new job but not for one who 
lost there jobs means it will create big jobs for very highly skilled persons but in India, it will
take away of many many small jobs, which will might effect as revenue generator but it will
to the peoples of our country. But this upgaradation is the demand of the hour, if we will not
change at this point we will have import the technology not develop, which will be very costly
in very aspect.
