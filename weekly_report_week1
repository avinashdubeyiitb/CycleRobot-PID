Week1 Report

In this week we were supposed to make a self balancing bicycle bot using reaction wheel in V-rep.
There were many sub sections in this project like literature survey,modelling in v-rep and simulation.

In the beginning of the week we have gone through many research papers to learn about the control system.

I learnt V-rep modelling and Lua coding in the youtube channel Leopoldo Armesto.There I came to know that
even though it is simulation physical parameters will affect the system.

In the first meeting our mentor made two groups where one should work on PID and another team on LQR.We got
PID,so we divided the work among ourselves.

In the second meeting our mentor assigned a task i.e to design asimple inverted pendulum with reaction wheel 
with pivot at the bottom.We learnt a lot of things in V-rep during this task.

In the next meeting our mentor assigned anoother task i.e to design the same model without pivot.

We faced lot of problems there.Then our mentor asked us to take help from the other team.After discussing 
our problem with the other team we came to know the problem we were facing i.e we used to write our code to
joints in actuation part but we were supposed write it in another function called sysCall_jointCallback().Then 
our problem got solved .

Next we designed the Cycle bot with reaction wheel.We used gyrosensor and accelerometer to get orientation 
because,if we use the function getObject Orientation then we will can use only on angle i.e w.rt x,y or z.
If we turn the cycle then we should get angle w.r.t to different axis.So we considered gyrosensor and accelerometer.
We used 96% of gyrosensor data and 4% of accelerometer data(Complementory filter) to get the the orientation.

I learnt a lot of things in this week,hoping to learn much more things in the upcoming weeks.
